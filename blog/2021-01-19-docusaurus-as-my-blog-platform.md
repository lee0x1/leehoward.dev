As the title says, "Docusaurus as My Blog Platform". Wait a minute there's
more to it. First let me say that I've tried alot of blogging software.
From the traditional Wordpress to Gatsby, and the JAM Stack.

<!--truncate-->

I love the new modern tooling that web development has adopted and I feel it's
important to embrace change but most of all, as a IT Professional and
undergraduate in Computer Science, I need a home not only for a blog but just
importantly a home for my ideas, papers or just about any self contained piece
of code or documentation collected in one place where others and myself alike
can go and find it.

Docusaurus is going to help me with this because its a two-fold. Docs and Blog.
I have some work ahead of me in order to setup the layout I'm in search of. But
I'm all in for it.
