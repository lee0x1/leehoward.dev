        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in the 80's, and 90's allowed me to play some of the greatest games
of all time. With aproximately 717 or so games, choosing a game seemed like a
daunting task.</p><p>I will actually take a little time playing a few games from childhood memory
that I never complete and decide the one that feels the best with the most
interesting story and I will play from beginning to end. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/snes-logo-202e09bf49aea76c02ef159975eb1fe0.png" width="860" height="252" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the title says, "Docusaurus as My Blog Platform". Wait a minute there's
more to it. First let me say that I've tried alot of blogging software.
From the traditional Wordpress to Gatsby, and the JAM Stack.</p><p>I love the new modern tooling that web development has adopted and I feel it's
important to embrace change but most of all, as a IT Professional and
undergraduate in Computer Science, I need a home not only for a blog but just
importantly a home for my ideas, papers or just about any self contained piece
of code or documentation collected in one place where others and myself alike
can go and find it.</p><p>Docusaurus is going to help me with this because its a two-fold. Docs and Blog.
I have some work ahead of me in order to setup the layout I'm in search of. But
I'm all in for it.</p>]]></content>
