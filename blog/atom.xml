        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the title says, "Docusaurus as My Blog Platform". Wait a minute there's
more to it. First let me say that I've tried alot of blogging software.
From the traditional Wordpress to Gatsby, and the JAM Stack.</p><p>I love the new modern tooling that web development has adopted and I feel it's
important to embrace change but most of all, as a IT Professional and
undergraduate in Computer Science, I need a home not only for a blog but just
importantly a home for my ideas, papers or just about any self contained piece
of code or documentation collected in one place where others and myself alike
can go and find it.</p><p>Docusaurus is going to help me with this because its a two-fold. Docs and Blog.
I have some work ahead of me in order to setup the layout I'm in search of. But
I'm all in for it.</p>]]></content>
