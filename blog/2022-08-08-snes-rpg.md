Growing up in the 80's, and 90's allowed me to play some of the greatest games
of all time. With aproximately 717 or so games, choosing a game seemed like a
daunting task.

I will actually take a little time playing a few games from childhood memory
that I never complete and decide the one that feels the best with the most
interesting story and I will play from beginning to end.
